		On Friday I did almost nothing. I went to school did what I was suppose to do for school then I went to workout at a neighborhood gym. At the gym I ran a couple of miles and played a little basketball after that I went home ate, and played video games for the rest of the night.

		On Saturday I woke up and my mom had made breakfast. As I ate I watched ESPN, they were talking about Marcus Smart and how he shoved a fan of saying something disrespectful to him. As the day went on I found myself really bored but luckally one of my favorite movies had came on Pulp Fiction. The movie stars Samuel Jackson,and John Travoltra if you didn't know. That was my Saturday.

		On Sunday I had no football to watch, which I am starting to get use to now. It was a few basketball games on, the Knicks and the Thunder played.also the Bulls played the Lakers. Ater those games I watched ESPN again and found out that a gay college player was going to be drafted into the NFL so that was interesting. After that I watched a little bit of this tribute to the Beatles and went to sleep.
